# Spotify Song Recommendation Project üéµ
Spotify is the most used music app across the globe with 573 million active [users.](https://thesocialshepherd.com/blog/spotify-statistics#:~:text=Spotify%20User%20Statistics,-Now%2C%20the%20question&text=As%20the%20foremost%20global%20audio,more%20than%20180%20markets%20worldwide.) Although most of us uses it everyday we don't know much about our taste of music until Spotify Wrapped comes at the end of the year. Hence, I wanted to dive deeper into my listening behaviour, by examining my personal data using [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/) library.  
## Motivation üí™üèª
The primary motivation behind this project is a deep, personal curiosity about my music preferences and the quest for a more precise way to discover songs that align with my taste, using established techniques. While Spotify currently provides a feature to enhance existing playlists, I've found that it doesn't quite meet my expectations. This discrepancy sparked my interest in investigating whether I could achieve better results in identifying songs that not only match but also enrich my top playlists. By harnessing the power of data analysis and machine learning, I aim to create a more tailored and satisfying music discovery experience. This project isn't just about fine-tuning a playlist; it's about enhancing my daily music experience by ensuring every song resonates with my personal taste and mood
## Data Source üìä
For this project, the data source is meticulously chosen from the tracks in my top Spotify playlists. These playlists are not just collections of songs, but they represent my most frequented musical choices. By directly fetching this data from my Spotify account, I've ensured that the foundation of my analysis is rooted in my actual listening habits. After extracting the details of these tracks, I integrated them into a single, comprehensive dataframe. This unified dataset is a treasure trove of my musical preferences, capturing the essence of my listening patterns. It's a deliberate approach to create a data-driven reflection of my musical journey, forming the perfect basis for a nuanced and personalized analysis of music mood prediction.
## Data Analysis üìà
Upon collecting the data, I delved into an in-depth feature analysis using powerful visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn. This step was crucial to understand the nuances of my dataset visually. I then proceeded to examine the correlations between different features, which played a pivotal role in guiding my feature selection process. By closely analyzing these correlations, I was able to identify the most relevant and impactful features for my analysis.

Next, I embarked on the crucial phase of feature engineering. Here, I focused on creating a 'mood' column, which I designated as the target feature for my model. This decision was influenced by my previous experience with a Spotify playlist analysis project. In that project, I observed the significance of the 'mood' feature and realized its potential applicability and value in my current endeavor. Incorporating this feature was a strategic choice, aimed at enhancing the predictive capability of my model and ensuring that the analysis resonates with the core objective of understanding the mood dynamics of my music preferences.
## Findings üîé
In the course of my analysis, a fascinating trend emerged: the majority of the music in my playlists is characterized by a Neutral mood. This discovery provided a crucial insight into my personal music preferences, shaping the direction of my subsequent analysis.

Further, I identified that features such as valence, tempo, and loudness displayed a high correlation with the energy of a song. Recognizing their predictive power, I strategically used these parameters as key indicators for determining the moods of the songs. This approach allowed me to create a more nuanced and accurate mood classification model, tailored to the specific characteristics of my music collection.

Additionally, I explored the application of the nearest neighbor method for song recommendation. This technique proved to be highly effective, aligning closely with the project's goal of personalized music discovery. It demonstrated a remarkable ability to suggest songs that not only matched the mood of my current preferences but also introduced a level of diversity and exploration within the same emotional spectrum.
## Limitations üö©
- Lack of data availability due to API limitations

## Future Work üî≠
Looking ahead, I envision the development of a cutting-edge application that goes beyond just recommending music. This application will be designed to not only curate a personalized playlist based on individual music preferences but also to calculate and reflect the average mood of the user, inferred from their listening history. By integrating sophisticated algorithms and the insights gained from my current project, this app will serve as a dynamic tool that adapts to the user's emotional landscape through their music choices. It will be a step forward in creating a more intuitive and emotionally responsive music experience, bridging the gap between technology and personal well-being. This endeavor will not only enhance the music listening experience but also provide valuable insights into the emotional well-being of the user, making it a unique blend of entertainment and self-awareness.
